Main entry point for PHASE 3 — Skeleton System (Teaching-First).

This file provides a minimal, runnable starting point that prints clear,
teaching-style logs when executed via `python src/main.py`. It intentionally
avoids importing other project modules, performing any trading logic, loading
configuration, or connecting to brokers or data sources.
